# Crunchyroll-Rich-Presence
A very shitty js script to have rich presence for what your watching on crunchyroll.
You can find a _much_ better implementation of this over on [LumiteDubbz's repo](https://github.com/LumiteDubbz/CRP-Next)!

# Installation

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/AleanaA/Crunchyroll-Rich-Presence.git`
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Start the app! `npm start`

# Pull Requests and Issues

I have no idea what I'm doing in js, but wanted a better solution than [a chrome extention](https://github.com/LoganMD/Crunchycord), so I took a crack at making this.

If there's something that can be done better, or you feel you can do something better than what I've done, feel free to make a PR or an issue with what you think could be changed, I'm more than open to feedback on this!
