# Pull Requests and Issues

I have no idea what I'm doing in js, but wanted a better solution than [a chrome extention](https://github.com/LoganMD/Crunchycord), so I took a crack at making this.

If there's something that can be done better, or you feel you can do something better than what I've done, feel free to make a PR or an issue with what you think could be changed, I'm more than open to feedback on this!
